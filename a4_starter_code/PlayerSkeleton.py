'''PlayerSkeleton.py
A bare-bones agent that plays Toro-Tile Straight,
but rather poorly.

To create your own agent, make a copy of this file, using
the naming convention YourUWNetID_TTS_agent.py.

If you need to import additional custom modules, use
a similar naming convention... e.g.,
YourUWNetID_TTS_custom_static.py
